        <h2>Vanilla cake topped with thinly sliced fresh apples</h2>
        <p>
            This cake is absolutely delicious when served warm right out of the oven, especially with a dollop of
            whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazingly, it tastes even better the next day; thanks to the apples, it remains a moist cake for 3 to 4 days
            and becomes even more flavorful as the apples infuse the cake with flavor.

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F - 180°C.</li>
                <li>Grease bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan.</li>

                <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla until creamy.</li>
                <li>
                    In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir the flour mixture into sugar mixture a
                    little at a time, alternating with the milk.

                    cutting all the way through. The apple slices will separate from each other while the cake bakes.

                <li>Put powdered sugar into a small sieve and gently tap to dust sugar evenly over the entire cake.</li>
