            <h3>How to Make Au Gratin Potatoes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart casserole dish.</li>
                <li>
                    Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper.
                    Layer onion slices over top, then top with with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and
                    pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook,
                    whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk,
                    about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual addition
                    and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese all at
                    once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and
                    cover
                    the dish with aluminum foil.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            </ol>
